A view modes plugin for Tainacan, which registers a list of 8 extra view modes that may be used to display your items list.
 
== Description ==
 
[Tainacan](https://tainacan.org/) is an open-source, powerful and flexible digital repository platform for WordPress. 

This plugin expands the [Tainacan plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tainacan/) functionality by adding support to 8 extra view modes besides the default ones (Masonry, Cards, Records, Table and List). The view modes display your items list giving different style to each item:

=== Mosaic ===

A simple and marginless mosaic of item thumbnails.

=== Frame === 

A centered aligned, framed thumbnails view, like gallery expositions.

=== Exhibition === 

A framed record view, where image and metadata are expanded on hover.

=== Albums === 

Thumbnails displayed as album covers with a disk inside.

=== Document === 

Records with stacked papers style, for displaying published research.

=== Books === 

A book cover view, made for library visualizations.

=== Polaroid === 

A framed picture view, similar to polaroid photographs.
